This repo is for the scripts and data, relevant to the automation of the analysis of nationally shared GMS-micro results.


As of writing, this includes:

* Automatically generated Quality Metrics files from sequencing devices from various vendors (Illumina, Oxford, etc.)
* Thresholds to automatically flag sequencing data as underperforming
* Outline for a quality control pipeline applicable to _virtually all_ forms of sequencing data
* Outline for a microbial analysis pipeline
